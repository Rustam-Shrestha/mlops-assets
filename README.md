# Post-Deployment: Monitoring, Retraining, Maturity, and Tooling in MLOps

## 1. Monitoring Machine Learning Models

- Once deployed, models must be monitored to ensure they perform reliably on new, unseen data.
- Monitoring helps detect performance degradation, infrastructure issues, and data drift.

### Types of Monitoring

- **Statistical Monitoring**:
  - Focuses on input data and model predictions.
  - Example: tracking churn probability outputs.
  - Detects shifts in data distribution or prediction quality.

- **Computational Monitoring**:
  - Focuses on system-level metrics.
  - Includes request volume, network usage, CPU/memory consumption.
  - Ensures infrastructure stability and responsiveness.

### Analogy

- Like monitoring a kitchen:
  - **Computational**: check appliances, electricity, staff activity.
  - **Statistical**: inspect ingredient quality and dish taste.

### Feedback Loop

- Ground truth (actual outcomes) becomes available over time.
- Comparing predictions to ground truth reveals:
  - Accuracy trends
  - Model degradation
  - Biases or failure patterns
- Enables retraining and continuous improvement.

---

## 2. Retraining Machine Learning Models

- Retraining adapts models to new data patterns and maintains performance over time.

### Why Retraining Is Needed

- Data changes due to evolving user behavior, market conditions, or external factors.
- Models trained on outdated data may become inaccurate.

### Types of Drift

- **Data Drift**:
  - Change in input data distribution.
  - Example: new customer demographics.

- **Concept Drift**:
  - Change in relationship between input and target.
  - Example: same customer profile now leads to non-churn instead of churn.

### Retraining Frequency

- Depends on:
  - Business environment volatility
  - Expert insight
  - Cost of retraining (compute, time)
  - Performance thresholds (e.g., accuracy > 90%)
  - Rate of model degradation

### Retraining Strategies

- **Separate Models**:
  - Train new model on new data only.
  - Maintain old model for reference or fallback.

- **Combined Data**:
  - Merge old and new data to train a unified model.
  - Choice depends on domain sensitivity and cost.

### Automatic Retraining

- Triggered by:
  - Data volume thresholds
  - Drift detection (e.g., average customer age shifts)
- Requires mature infrastructure and monitoring systems.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering transforms raw data into optimized inputs for machine learning models. It includes aggregation, construction, transformation, and selection.

### Data Aggregation
- Combine multiple datasets to enrich training data.
- Example: `DataAggregator` class uses `pd.read_csv` and `pd.concat` to merge sources.

### Feature Construction
- Create new features by combining or transforming existing ones.
- Example: `FeatureConstructor` computes deviation from column means.

### Feature Transformation
- Normalize or scale features to improve model performance.
- Example: `StandardScaler` standardizes features to zero mean and unit variance.

### Feature Selection
- Reduce dimensionality by retaining only relevant features.
- Techniques: Chi-squared test, PCA.

### Integrated Pipeline Example
```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, chi2

pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('aggregate', DataAggregator()),
    ('construction', FeatureConstructor()),
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('select', SelectKBest(score_func=chi2, k=10)),
])
X_transformed = pipeline.fit_transform(X)

Model Serialization

Serialization enables saving and loading trained models for reuse or deployment.

import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

trained_model = SimpleModel()
torch.save(trained_model.state_dict(), 'model.pt')

loaded_model = SimpleModel()
loaded_model.load_state_dict(torch.load('model.pt'))
loaded_model.eval()

# ML Concepts: Feature Engineering to Deployment

## Feature Engineering Techniques
- **Aggregation**: Summarizing data by grouping and applying statistical functions like sum, mean, median, or count (e.g., calculating total sales per customer or average transaction value per region). This reduces data granularity while preserving key patterns for modeling.
- **Construction**: Creating new features from existing ones to capture domain-specific insights, such as computing ratios (e.g., debt-to-income ratio), interaction terms (e.g., multiplying age and income), or derived metrics (e.g., BMI from height and weight).
- **Transformation**: Modifying data to improve model compatibility, including normalization (e.g., scaling features to [0,1]), log transformations to handle skewed distributions, or encoding categorical variables (e.g., one-hot or label encoding).
- **Selection**: Identifying the most predictive features to reduce dimensionality and noise, using techniques like correlation analysis, mutual information, recursive feature elimination, or statistical tests like chi-squared or ANOVA (e.g., SelectKBest).

## Unified Feature Engineering Pipeline
- Integrates components like DataAggregator (for grouping and aggregating data), FeatureConstructor (for creating new features), StandardScaler (for normalizing data to zero mean and unit variance), and SelectKBest (for selecting top k features based on statistical significance).
- Ensures a streamlined, reproducible process from raw data to model-ready inputs, minimizing errors and enabling automation.

## Model Versioning and Serialization
- **Versioning**: Tracks model iterations to ensure reproducibility, traceability, and rollback capability. Tools like Git (for code and configs) or MLflow (for model metadata) manage versions, hyperparameters, and performance metrics.
- **Serialization**: Converts models into portable, savable formats for deployment without retraining. For example, PyTorch models use torch.save() to store weights and load_state_dict() to reload, while scikit-learn models use pickle for serialization.
- Enables consistent model deployment across environments, critical for production workflows.

## Model Packaging with Docker
- Conceptual workflow: Start with a base image (e.g., python:3.x), define dependencies in a Dockerfile (e.g., pip install numpy torch), copy model artifacts and inference code, and set an entrypoint (e.g., CMD ["python", "serve.py"]) to run a prediction server.
- Ensures portability across development, testing, and production environments, simplifies dependency management, and supports scalability with container orchestration tools like Kubernetes.

## Hands-On: Bag-of-Words on Quora Dataset
- Implemented a bag-of-words (BoW) model for Quora question duplicate detection using raw text features (term frequency vectors), achieving ~75% accuracy without feature engineering.
- Explored basic feature engineering techniques like TF-IDF weighting and n-grams to enhance feature representation, with accuracy testing still pending.

## Scaling Strategies
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Involves distributing workload across multiple machines or instances to handle increased data volume or user demand. This is achieved by deploying models on clusters (e.g., Kubernetes, Apache Spark) where each node processes a subset of data or requests. Ideal for stateless applications or parallelizable tasks like batch inference. Challenges include managing inter-node communication and ensuring data consistency.
- **Vertical Scaling**: Upgrades resources on a single machine, such as increasing CPU cores, RAM, or GPU memory, to handle compute-intensive tasks like training deep learning models. Suitable for scenarios where model complexity (e.g., large neural networks) demands high memory or processing power. Limitations include hardware ceilings and higher costs compared to horizontal scaling.
- **Model Complexity vs. Compute Constraints**: Scaling strategy depends on model requirements. Simple models (e.g., logistic regression) scale well horizontally due to low resource needs, enabling distributed inference across many nodes. Complex models (e.g., transformers) often require vertical scaling to accommodate memory-intensive operations, though techniques like model parallelism or offloading to GPUs/TPUs can complement horizontal scaling. Balancing model size, inference latency, and infrastructure costs is critical for efficient scaling.
- **Practical Considerations**: Horizontal scaling excels in cloud environments with elastic resources (e.g., AWS EC2, GCP Compute Engine), while vertical scaling suits on-premises setups or specialized hardware (e.g., NVIDIA DGX systems). Hybrid approaches, combining both, optimize for cost, performance, and reliability in production.

## MLOps Automation
- **CI/CD/CT/CM**: Continuous Integration (CI) automates code testing and merging, Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) streamlines model releases, Continuous Training (CT) retrains models on fresh data, and Continuous Monitoring (CM) tracks performance in production. Tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI enable these workflows.
- Aligns ML models with business impact metrics (e.g., revenue lift, user retention) by automating model updates and ensuring rapid deployment cycles, reducing manual overhead and errors.

## Testing in ML Pipelines
- **Unit Tests**: Validate individual components, such as feature transformers or model functions, to ensure correctness (e.g., checking if a scaler outputs zero mean).
- **Smoke Tests**: Quick checks to verify system stability post-deployment, ensuring basic functionality (e.g., model loads and predicts without crashing).
- **Integration Tests**: Confirm that pipeline components (e.g., data preprocessing, model inference) work together seamlessly.
- **Expectation Tests**: Validate data properties in the pipeline, such as expected ranges, null value checks, or schema consistency.

## Model and Data Drift
- **Data Drift**: Occurs when input data distribution changes (e.g., feature drift: new user demographics; label drift: shifting target variable patterns), degrading model performance.
- **Concept Drift**: Shifts in the relationship between features and target (e.g., changing user preferences in recommendation systems).
- **Model Drift**: Performance degradation due to data or concept drift, often indicating model staleness.
- **Detection**: Use techniques like permutation importance to assess feature relevance, statistical tests (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov for distribution shifts), or monitor feature/label distributions over time.
- **Mitigation**: Implement retraining schedules, adaptive models, or drift-aware algorithms to maintain performance.

## Fairness and Monitoring
- **Fairness**: Assess model bias across groups using metrics like demographic parity or equal opportunity to ensure equitable predictions.
- **Holdout Testing**: Evaluate model generalization on separate test sets to prevent overfitting and validate robustness.
- **Monitoring**: Track model drift, prediction drift, and staleness using real-time metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1 score) and alerts for anomalies, ensuring sustained performance in production.

## Summary
This covers feature engineering (aggregation, construction, transformation, selection), unified pipelines, model versioning/serialization, Docker packaging, advanced scaling strategies (horizontal, vertical, and model complexity trade-offs), MLOps automation (CI/CD/CT/CM), comprehensive testing, and drift/fairness monitoring—bridging theoretical concepts to production-ready ML workflows.
